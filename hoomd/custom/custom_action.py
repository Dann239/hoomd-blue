    """Base class for all Python Actions.

    This class is the parent class for all Python `Action` subclasses. This
    class requires all subclasses to implement the :meth:`~.act` method which
    performs the Python object's task whether that be updating the system,
    writing output, or analyzing some property of the system.

    To use subclasses of this class, the object must be passed as an argument
    to a `hoomd.update.CustomUpdater`, `hoomd.write.CustomWriter`, or
    `hoomd.tune.CustomTuner` constructor.

    If the pressure, rotational kinetic energy, or external field virial is
    needed for a subclass, the flags attribute of the class needs to be set with
    the appropriate flags from the internal `Action.Flags` enumeration.

    For advertising loggable quantities through the wrapping object, the
    decorator `hoomd.logging.log` can be used.
